            <p class="title is-5">Detailed Project Description:</p>
            <p>The Church held that Dobbs identified the date's significance in the 1950s, claiming that the world was to experience a massive change on that date when Xists, beings from Planet X, would arrive on Earth. SubGenius leaders declared that their paying members were to be transported onto spaceships for union with goddesses as the world was destroyed, although a few posited that they would be sent to a joyful hell. In anticipation of the event, X-Day "drills" were held in 1996 and 1997.</p>
            <p>In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a "clothing-optional" campground in Sherman, New York, attended by about 400 members. The event was ostensibly intended to celebrate the coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at that time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998; this has been interpreted as a satire of the way that religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures. Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or form of "performance art". Steve Bevilacqua, the Church's business manager, admitted that his group made strange predictions about aliens, but contended that their statements were as believable as the account of Jesus' walk on water. Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5 after 1998. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated. Cusack casts the productions as carnivalesque or an echo of ancient Greek satyr plays.</p>

                <p>The first command is to shun regular employment and stop working. This encapsulates the Church's view that to repent is to "SLACK OFF" (sic), in opposition to the idea of working for a living. SubGenius leaders state that it is permissible for members to collect public assistance in lieu of maintaining employment.</p>
                <p>The second command is to purchase products that are sold by the Church, which its leaders teach was founded by Dobbs to gain wealth.[40] Unlike most religious groups, the Church proudly admits it is for-profit (presumably mocking some religious groups that seem to have ulterior financial motives). Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the "greed is good" mentality of the 1980s, and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes "the consumption of popular cultural artefacts", this consumption is "simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix".</p>
                <p>The third command is to rebel against "law and order": specifically, the Church condemns security cameras and encourages computer hacking. Cusack notes that this instruction recalls Robert Anton Wilson's critique of law and order.</p>

                <p>Local groups of members of the Church of the SubGenius are known as "clenches". They host periodic events known as "devivals", which include sermons, music, and other art forms. Their leaders take comical names and give angry rants, and many devivals occur in bars or similar venues. Cusack compares the style of the services to Pentecostal revivalism; David Giffels of the Akron Beacon Journal casts them as "campy preaching sessions". Cusack posits that these events are examples of Peter Lamborn Wilson's concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones, spaces in which the ordinary constraints of social control are suspended. On one occasion, the presence of the wife of a Church leader at a SubGenius meeting that included public nudity and a goat costume contributed to her losing custody of her children in a court case. However, the publicity surrounding the event was ultimately a boon to the Church's recruitment efforts.</p>

                <p>The Church also celebrates several holidays in honor of characters drawn from fiction and popular culture, such as Monty Python, Dracula, and Klaatu. The Association for Consciousness Exploration and pagan groups have occasionally assisted the Church in its events. Some SubGenius members put little emphasis on meetings, citing the Church's focus on individualism, although the Book of the SubGenius discusses community.</p>
